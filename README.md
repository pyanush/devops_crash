Hello, guys :)

My name is Olya.
I'm passionate about learning new things, travelling, music and sport (mainly - tennis, swimming, HIIT, MTB)!
Currently working as QA/AQA.

Actually, I can leverage projects with chaos and doing magic before deadlines :D

(But yeah, I agree, better do it on time rather than in a rush)

Have some Java programming skills, a bit of Python, and dreaming about getting familiar with JS as well.
I've got used to self-learning, using different resources (such as online tutorials, books, YouTube video, etc.).

My fav music is ambient, chillout, sometimes rock, pop, R-n-B
Well, from yesterdaty cannot stop listening to "Trafoier, Xram, EQRIC - Take Me Home (ft. Sophiella)" https://youtu.be/WROdPB6U0MM 
Likely, we're living in Shazham ages, so, I can grab such cool music anywhere I want (in supermarket, at taxi, in a bar, even at sport gym).

Also, learning Spanish and hoping, that one day I'll be able to climb on Roraima plateau.

I do believe that everyone of us can make this world a better place!

Wish everyone so that your dream come true!
